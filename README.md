*LORCAN* "LOng Read Consensus ANalysis" 	 
======================================        


From basecalled nanopore reads in FASTQ format, the pipeline produces consensus sequences     
for each barcoded sample, based on read alignment to best sequence matches from a customized reference database.  
All analysis steps are automated and a final report (PDF) is produced for each barcoded sample.
